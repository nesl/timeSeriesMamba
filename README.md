## Introduction
Time-LLM is a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. Essentially, it uses a foundation model that is pretrained on language and appends some prompting and finetuning architectures to the input and output stages for the purpose of analyzing time series data.
For NESL, we're interested in examining how different LLM backbones can be swapped in and their relative performances. Right now, I've swapped in Mamba1 in place of the GPT transformer backbone, but we'll look at converting this into other versions in the future if necessary. Currently, we may focus our priorities on full training of different architectures rather than using this method of finetuning models.

- Time-LLM comprises two key components: (1) reprogramming the input time series into text prototype representations that are more natural for the LLM, and (2) augmenting the input context with declarative prompts (e.g., domain expert knowledge and task instructions) to guide LLM reasoning.

## Datasets
You can access the well pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NF7VEefXCmXuWNbnNe858WvQAkJ_7wuP/view?usp=sharing), then place the downloaded contents under `./dataset`

## Quick Demos
1. Download datasets and place them under `./dataset`
2. Tune the model. We provide five experiment scripts for demonstration purpose under the folder `./scripts`. For example, you can evaluate on ETT datasets by:

```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTh1.sh 
```
```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTh2.sh 
```
```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTm1.sh 
```
```bash
bash ./scripts/TimeLLM_ETTm2.sh
```

## Detailed usage

Please refer to ```run_main.py```, ```run_m4.py``` and ```run_pretrain.py``` for the detailed description of each hyperparameter.
